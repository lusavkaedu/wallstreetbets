I'm not a big technicals guy...just DCA kinda dude.  But for diversity sake I'll buy up shares in companies I find that I think will do well, I'm just perplexed how some find the the finds they do.\\n\\nThanks!</td>\n",

I'm not a big technicals guy...just DCA kinda dude.  But for diversity sake I'll buy up shares in companies I find that I think will do well, I'm just perplexed how some find the the finds they do.\\n\\nThanks!\n",
